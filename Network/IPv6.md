# IPv6 Headers

| S.N. | Field | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| 1    | Version (4-bits)               | It represents the version of Internet Protocol, i.e. 0110.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2    | Traffic Class (8-bits)         | These 8 bits are divided into two parts. The most significant 6 bits are used for Type of Service to let the Router Known what services should be provided to this packet. The least significant 2 bits are used for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).                                                                                                    |
| 3    | Flow Label (20-bits)           | This label is used to maintain the sequential flow of the packets belonging to a communication. The source labels the sequence to help the router identify that a particular packet belongs to a specific flow of information. This field helps avoid re-ordering of data packets. It is designed for streaming/real-time media.                                |
| 4    | Payload Length (16-bits)       | This field is used to tell the routers how much information a particular packet contains in its payload. Payload is composed of Extension Headers and Upper Layer data. With 16 bits, up to 65535 bytes can be indicated; but if the Extension Headers contain Hop-by-Hop Extension Header, then the payload may exceed 65535 bytes and this field is set to 0. |
| 5    | Next Header (8-bits)           | This field is used to indicate either the type of Extension Header, or if the Extension Header is not present then it indicates the Upper Layer PDU. The values for the type of Upper Layer PDU are same as IPv4’s.                                                                                                                                             |
| 6    | Hop Limit (8-bits)             | This field is used to stop packet to loop in the network infinitely. This is same as TTL in IPv4. The value of Hop Limit field is decremented by 1 as it passes a link (router/hop). When the field reaches 0 the packet is discarded.                                                                                                                          |
| 7    | Source Address (128-bits)      | This field indicates the address of originator of the packet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 8    | Destination Address (128-bits) | This field provides the address of intended recipient of the packet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
